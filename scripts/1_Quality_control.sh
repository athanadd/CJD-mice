#The .fastq files were acquired.

#The files were analysed using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) without any extra options.

#Trimmings were performed using trim_galore! (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) in order to remove bad
#reads and adapter sequences.
